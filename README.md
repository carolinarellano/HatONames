# HatONames
Implementation of HatONamesCLI 

1. Implemented a function to randomize an array that has the lines' numbers of the file with the names.
2. By having randomized that numbers of lines, started reading the file and printing just the last position in the file (by using the random number)
3. To get the names, use "h" and the name will be displayed.

About compilation and executing...
1. Download the repository (or clone it), then, go to your CLI and get to the repository's path.
2. After that, write: gcc -o hat HatONames.c
3. The next you need to do is writing again: hat and the Hat of names will be executed correctly.

Enjoy it! :)
